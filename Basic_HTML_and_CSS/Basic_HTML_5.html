	<h1>HTML Entities</h1>
	<p>Some characters are reserved in HTML. If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags. Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.</p>
	<p>A character entity looks like this: &entity_name; OR &#entity_number;</p>
	<p>To display a less than sign (<) we must write (remove the space between symbols and letters/numbers): & lt = &lt; or &# 60 = &#60;</p>
