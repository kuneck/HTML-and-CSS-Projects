		<h1>Will God of War: Ragnarok be the Game of the Year 2022?</h1>
		<h4>
		<Main>The sequel to 2018's critically acclaimed God of War, the new Santa Monica's studio game will be released in November 9th and emerges as one of the main competitors to receive the GOTY 2022.
		<p>Although last year's competition didn't have as many big games like 2022, there were some good games like Resident Evil Village, Deathloop and the winner It Takes Two (click <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-winners-revealed">here</a> to check the full list of nominees and winners) , however this has been an incredible year for gamers, with games like Elden Ring, Horizon Forbidden West and God of War Ragnarok itself.
 		</p>
		<p>Here is a quote from IGN's website about the new game:</p>
		<p><blockquote cite="https://www.ign.com/articles/lets-talk-about-god-of-war-ragnarok">
		It's safe to say that Ragnar√∂k looks to be one of the biggest releases in the latter half of 2022, and many of us on staff are excited to see where the story will take us after the events of God of War 2018.
